# `Stack Overflow Clone Overview:`

The Stack Overflow clone is a web application designed to replicate the fundamental features of the popular Q&A platform, Stack Overflow. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the backend, frontend, and database, respectively. The application incorporates user authentication, question posting, answering, voting, and a simple chatbot for enhanced user interaction.

# `Key Features:`

 `01.User Authentication:`

    The application includes a robust user authentication system, allowing users to sign up and log in securely.
    User authentication is handled through JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring secure transmission of user data.

`02.Q&A Functionality:`

    Users can post questions with titles, detailed bodies, and  tags describing the question's context.
    The application supports answering questions, allowing users to provide detailed responses to posted queries.

`03.Voting System:`

    Users can upvote or downvote both questions and answers, contributing to the overall community-driven ranking of content.

`04.User Profile:`

    Each user has a profile that displays relevant information such as their joined date, tags associated with their interests, and an "about" section.

`05.Redux State Management:`

    The application uses Redux for state management, maintaining a centralized store for handling user authentication, current user data, and question-related information.

`06.Chatbot Integration:`

    A simple AI-powered chatbot is integrated into the application, allowing users to interact with the AI for general queries or assistance.
    The chatbot uses the OpenAI GPT model to generate responses based on user input.

`07.Email Verification:`

    Users undergo email verification to enhance security and ensure the validity of user accounts.
    Email verification involves sending an OTP to the user's email address, and users must enter the OTP for account activation.

`08.Password Hashing:`

    User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt, ensuring the protection of user credentials.

`09.Responsive UI:`

    The user interface is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal experience across different devices and screen sizes.

`10.Toast Notifications:`

    The react-hot-toast library is utilized for displaying toast notifications, offering real-time feedback to users during email verification processes.

`11.RESTful API:`

    The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js, providing a RESTful API for handling various operations, such as posting questions, voting, and user authentication.

# `Tech Stack:`

    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (mongoose)
    Frontend: React.js, Redux (state management), React Router
    Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    Email Service: Nodemailer (for sending verification emails)
